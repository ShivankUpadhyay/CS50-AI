This code implements  an AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph.

It is inspired from the research in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is computer vision, allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs â€“ stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more.

We have taken in use the TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs.

In this project we use the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.
