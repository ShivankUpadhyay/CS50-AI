This code implements an AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases.

Knowing the structure of a sentence can help a computer to better understand the meaning of the sentence, and it can also help the computer extract information out of a sentence. 
In particular, itâ€™s often useful to extract noun phrases out of a sentence to get an understanding for what the sentence is about.

We use the context-free grammar formalism to parse English sentences to determine their structure.
