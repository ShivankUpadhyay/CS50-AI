This code implements the PageRank algorithm used by search engines like Google.

In PageRankâ€™s algorithm, a website is more important if it is linked to by other important websites, and links from less important websites have their links weighted less.
It turns out that there are multiple strategies for calculating these rankings. 

Method 1: Random Surfer Model

Method 2: Iterative Algorithm

Both the methods are implemented by the AI.
