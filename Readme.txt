This program implements an AI to play Minesweeper.

Whenever a cell is clicked inside the board, we store the relevant information obtained which our AI uses to make deductions for further possible safe moves
that can be made.

At any point in the game, the user can either perform a move himself or let AI perform the next move as per deductions it has made till now.

If no certain deductions can be made regarding a safe move, the AI performs a random move (making sure that the move is definitely not a known mine).

The goal of the game is to flag (i.e., identify) each of the mines.
