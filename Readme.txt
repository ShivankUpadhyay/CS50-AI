The given code implements an AI to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.

Given information about a user — how many pages they’ve visited, whether they’re shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, etc. the AI predicts whether or not the user will make a purchase.

We develop a nearest-neighbor classifier model to solve this problem.

To train the classifier, we use data from a shopping website from about 12,000 users sessions.

We ultimately calculate the values: sensitivity (also known as the “true positive rate”) and specificity (also known as the “true negative rate”).
